🚀 Live Website:
👉 https://sudipto-jury.github.io/Github-Page-URL-Project/

This project is a simple static School Website built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript and deployed using GitHub Pages.

The goal of this project was to practice structured Git branching workflow and manual deployment using GitHub Pages.

Git

GitHub

GitHub Pages

🌿 Git Branching Strategy Used

Instead of pushing everything directly to main, I followed a structured workflow:

1️⃣ Created Separate Feature Branches

feature-html → Developed website structure

feature-css → Added styling and layout

feature-js → Implemented JavaScript functionality

2️⃣ Development Process

✔️ Created each feature branch from main
✔️ Worked independently on each branch
✔️ Committed changes with proper messages
✔️ Pushed feature branches to GitHub

Example commands used:

git checkout -b feature-html
git add .
git commit -m "Added HTML structure"
git push origin feature-html
3️⃣ Pull Request & Merge Process

After completing each feature:

Created a Pull Request from feature branch → main

Reviewed changes

Merged using GitHub Pull Request

Used git merge via PR interface

This helped simulate real-world collaboration workflow.

🌍 Deployment Using GitHub Pages

After merging all feature branches into main:

Went to Repository Settings

Clicked on Pages

Selected branch: main

Saved configuration

GitHub generated a live public URL

Website became accessible globally 🌐

🎯 What I Learned
